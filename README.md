# University Trial Physiological Data Anaylsis

This repository contains anaylsis of the Stress monitoring dataset from [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/21/8135) published in 2022.

It explores preprocessing the data into labelled usable timeseries dataframe and uses common machine learning models to predict the stress label.
